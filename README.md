Wi-Fi, Cellular, and Magnetometer Data Collector
----------
A simple app which will collect Wi-Fi AP and cell tower information, display them in a RecyclerView, and write them out to file - potentially a .csv. Also, collects magnetometer data and displays the readings in a real-time graph. With some tweaking, this can be converted to displaying any kind of sensor data in the graph.
