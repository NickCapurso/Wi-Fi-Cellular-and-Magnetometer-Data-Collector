Wi-Fi, Cellular, and Magnetometer Data Collector
----------
A simple app which will collect Wi-Fi AP and cell tower information, display them in a RecyclerView, and write them out to file - potentially a .csv. Also, collects magnetometer data and displays the readings in a real-time graph. With some tweaking, this can be converted to displaying any kind of sensor data in the graph.

See UserManual.pdf for more details.

Note: The API for obtaining cell tower information is still not very mature, so results may vary based on network type and generation.

## Quick Start
    1. Supports Android devices running version 4.4 (KitKat) or higher.
    2. The default filepath is the device's Documents folder.
    3. The default filename is of the format <Data>_<Datatype>_<Timestamp>.csv
    4. The default file extension (.csv) can be changed at runtime.
    5. The format of the output file is an unsorted comma-seprated list for import into Microsoft Excel.
